Polynomial Regression to tune DC motor



The similar behaviour of the graphs of motors of different specifications leads to the assumption that different motors behave almost similarly and that the graph of any other DC motor can be mapped on to the base polynomial function found.
The ratio will be approximately to the powers 1.x where x is negligible enough to be neutralised using the error correction code.
